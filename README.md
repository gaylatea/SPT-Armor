# SPTarkov Working Plate Carriers

This is an extension/adaptation of Kobrakon's amazing work in [Realistic Plate Carriers](https://hub.sp-tarkov.com/files/file/842-realistic-plate-system/). I had some Strong Opinions(tm) on certain things, though, so I've worked through and made some
modifications.

# Changes
* By default, only actual plate carriers (hand-selected) are modified by this, to give a good reason to use them under this new system instead of just using a PACA.
* By default, only certain plates are actually created in-game. Level 1 glass plates are less than useless, so why burden users with having them around.
* Code has been cleaned up and refactored pretty extensively.
