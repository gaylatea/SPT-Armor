# Another Fuckin' Plates Mod

## Installing
* Install `Gaylatea-Armor-$VERSION/` into your server's `user/mods` folder.
* Install `Gaylatea-Armor.dll` into your client's `BepInEx/plugins` folder.

## Notable Changes
* A specified list of armors that would actually have removable plates, from the vanilla game, are modified to instead have no armor values of their own but instead depend on removable plates.
    * Armors with integrated protection are left exactly as they are.
* Bots that get these armors will also receive plates.
    * Bosses are hard-coded to receive the same armor values they would from the vanilla game.
* Airdrops may include plates of any sort.
* Ragman is given a basic Slick carrier that you can use from the beginning of the game.
* Lv 1 traders are given some shit plates for you to use; their deals get better over time but they do not carry many different kinds.
    * It is intended that access to Lv. 6 removable armor should be extremely rare, usually stolen from a killed boss or PMC.

## Credits 
* Kobrakon's [Realistic Plate Carriers](https://hub.sp-tarkov.com/files/file/842-realistic-plate-system/) for initial inspiration and a lot of the base of this. The plate assets included here are from his mod.
* Katto's KMC-GEAR/KMC-CORE for balancing ideas and more.
